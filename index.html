                                    <p>Hi there! My name is James Krause and I'm from Shakopee, Minnesota. I currently live at home with my parents in Shakopee after
                                        graduating from Minnesota State University, Mankato and needed a place to stay while I find a new place. As of now, I share the
                                        house with my parents and our 2 cats, Narc (19) and Tasha (19).

                                    <p>When I'm not working or hanging out with my friends, you can find me doing a few things. When I was 5, I started bowling
                                        in a junior league, and continued to bowl on a league until 2 years ago when I moved out to Mankato. I was even on my high
                                        school bowling team for 5 years. When I was 10, I began playing electric guitar, and later expanding into acoustic and bass guitar.

                                    <p>In December of 2021, I bought my first 3D printer, the Ender 3 v2, and wow did I underestimate the time and fiddling it would take to
                                        get the first print done. Once I got it dialed in, it was amazing to see it go to work and make things that I modeled on my computer,
                                         such as a lightbox and a cable holder. I also play games on my computer, such as Forza Horizon and the newly released Spider-Man Remastered.

                                    on the page and it will close. But after having some friends and family, there were two cases of clicking any where on the page would not close the page. Unfortunately,
