                                <p>One of the issues with the modal that I have not been able to figure out, is to close the modal. In most cases, you can click the X in the top right, or click any where
                                    on the page and it will close. But after having some friends and family, there were two cases of clicking any where on the page would not close the page. Unfortunately, 
                                    it was on an Android with Chrome, and an iPhone with Safari.

                                <p>One of the harder things to implement was in the use case of someone placing a bet, say $50, but then changing it to a custom amount. With the original code, it would take 
                                    out both the custom amount and the preset amount, causing the bank to possibly go negative. Now, it just resets the bet and then applies the custom bet.

                                hand. The cards animate from the face down card on the right and flip to reveal the value of the card.

                                <p>For a while, it was hard to decide how I wanted the cards to go onto the table and how I wanted to animate it. After some research, I found a sleek implementation of a flip
                                     card animation and applied it to my use case. Using an offset variable in Javascript, it uses the same animation for all cards but with different position arguments.
